how was the error evaluated?

**Purpose and Procedure (Briefly)**  
Provide a concise description of the goals of the experiment: what is being measured, verified, or tested. What needs to be measured? With which instruments? You can include photos or diagrams.

- **Data Collection in Tabular Format**  
  Present not only processed data but also raw data (the latter can be included as an appendix if necessary).  
  Include any relevant graphs with properly defined axes (units of measurement, significant figures, axis labels). Estimate the measurement errors of the quantities measured (justify the method chosen).  

- **Final Value of the Quantity to Determine and Its Uncertainty**  
  Always report the values with their respective uncertainties, ensuring attention to significant figures:  

- **Comparison with Known Data and Evaluation of Discrepancies.**

- **Additional Notes:** Report any problems encountered, final comments, and interpretations.  

**Note:** Do not include theoretical descriptions or detailed apparatus descriptions, as these will be addressed during the exam presentation.
