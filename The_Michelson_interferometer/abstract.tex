The Michelson interferometer was used to measure the wavelength of a monochromatic red laser, the refractive index of air at atmospheric pressure, the coherence lengths of white and green light, and the separation between the two sodium D-lines. For the laser wavelength, a weighted average yielded \(\lambda = (636.0 \pm 19.0)\,\text{nm}\), consistent with the nominal value of \(632.8\,\text{nm}\). The refractive index of air was determined as \(n_a = (1.000266 \pm 0.000012)\), demonstrating high precision. Coherence lengths were measured as \(L_{\text{c,w}} = (13.33 \pm 1.60)\,\mu\text{m}\) and \(L_{\text{c,g}} = (27.00 \pm 0.58)\,\mu\text{m}\). The separation between sodium D-lines was calculated as \(\Delta \lambda = (6.41 \pm 0.53)\,\text{Ã…}\), in agreement with the literature value. These results highlight the capability of the Michelson interferometer for precise optical measurements.
