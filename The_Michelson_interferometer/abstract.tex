\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}


The Michelson interferometer experiment aims to measure the wavelength of a monochromatic red laser beam, the refractive index of air at atmospheric pressure, the coherence length of light packets, and the separation between the two lines of the sodium emission spectrum. This experiment demonstrates the application of the interferometer to analyze wave phenomena with high precision, utilizing interference patterns to determine key optical properties.
