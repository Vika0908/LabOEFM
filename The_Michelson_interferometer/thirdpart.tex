\subsection{Purpose and Procedure}

The objective of this part was to measure the coherence length (\(L_c\)) of white and green light using a Michelson interferometer. The light sources emit wave packets with finite lengths, resulting in a measurable range of fringe visibility. After initially aligning the interferometer with a laser at zero optical path difference, the laser was replaced by the white or green light source. The movable mirror (S3) was then adjusted slowly and the difference between two recorded positions (\(x_0\) and \(x\)) was noted. Due to a mechanical lever ratio, the actual mirror displacement is one-fifth of \(|x_0 - x|\). Thus, the range (\(\Delta x\)) over which the fringes remained visible corresponds to \(|x_0 - x|/5\), and this effective displacement is the coherence length of the respective light source:

\[
L_c = \Delta x.
\]

The procedure was repeated for both white and green light.

\subsection{Analysis and Error Evaluation}

The measured values of \(x_0\), \(x\), and \(\Delta x\) for the coherence length of white and green light are in the tables below:

The mean coherence length for white light and the standard deviation of the mean:
\[
L_{\text{c,w}} = (13.33 \pm 1.60) \, \mu \text{m}
\]  
The mean coherence length for green light and the standard deviation of the mean:
\[
L_{\text{c,g}} = (27.00 \pm 0.58) \, \mu \text{m}
\]  

The main difficulty encountered was the precise determination of the point at which fringes disappear. This led to some variability in the measurements.
